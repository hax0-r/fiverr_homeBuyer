                rules regarding your use of this website, and any additional terms that may apply to specific services

            <p>Our Privacy Policy details how we handle your personal and non-personal information.
            </p>
            <h1>WHAT IS NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOW IS IT COLLECTED AND USED?
            </h1>
            <p>Non-personal information is data that cannot be used to identify you. When you visit this website to read
                information, such as details about our services, we may collect certain non-personal information from
                your computer’s web browser. Since non-personal information does not identify you, there are no
                restrictions on how we can use or share it.
            </p>
            <h1>WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOW IS IT COLLECTED?
            </h1>
            <p>Personal information identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, email address,
                telephone number, and fax number. We may collect personal information from you in various ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you send us an application or other forms.</li>
                <li>When you conduct a transaction with us, our affiliates, or others.</li>
                <li>When we collect information in support of a transaction, such as credit card details.</li>
                <li>In some areas of this website, you may provide personal information about yourself to receive
                    specific information, purchase access to our products or services, or participate in an activity.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h1>ARE COOKIES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES USED TO COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?
            </h1>
            <p>Yes, we use cookies and related technologies, such as web beacons, to collect information on our website.
                A cookie is a text file placed on your hard drive by a web server. Cookies cannot run programs or
                deliver viruses to your computer. They are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server
                in the domain that issued the cookie to you. The primary purpose of cookies is to provide a convenience
                feature to save you time. For example, if you register with us, a cookie helps Existing Homebuyers
                recall your specific information on subsequent visits, simplifying the process of recording your
                personal information, such as billing addresses and shipping addresses. When you return to the same
                Existing Homebuyers website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, enabling you to
                use the customized features with ease. A web beacon is a small graphic image that allows the party
                setting the web beacon to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page,
                web-based document, or email message, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP
                address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to, and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web
                beacons are generally invisible to the user, but any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or
                email, including HTML-based content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to count visitors
                to the web pages on the website or to monitor how our users navigate the website, and we may include web
                beacons in email messages to count how many messages sent were actually opened, acted upon, or
                forwarded.
                <br> <br>
                Third-party vendors may also use cookies on our website. For example, we may contract with third parties
                to track and analyze anonymous usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and members
                using cookies. This information is shared externally only on an anonymous, aggregated basis. These third
                parties use persistent cookies to help us improve the visitor experience, manage site content, and track
                visitor behavior. We may also contract with a third party to send emails to our registered users. To
                measure and improve the effectiveness of our email communications, the third party sets cookies. All
                data collected by this third party on behalf of Existing Homebuyers is used solely by or on behalf of
                Existing Homebuyers and is shared externally only on an anonymous, aggregated basis. From time to time,
                we may allow third parties to post advertisements on our website, which may include a cookie or web
                beacon served by the third party. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of information collected
                from you by third-party ad servers. We do not control cookies in such third-party ads, and you should
                check the privacy policies of those advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies
                and other technology before linking to an ad. We will not share your personal information with these
                companies, but these companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites to
                provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may interest you, and
                they may share your personal information that you provide to them with others.
                <br><br>
                You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but
                you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
                cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Existing Homebuyers
                websites you visit.

            <h1>HOW DOES EXISTING HOMEBUYERS USE PERSONAL INFORMATION?
            </h1>
            <p>Existing Homebuyers may keep and use personal information we collect from or about you to provide you
                with access to this website or other products or services, respond to your requests, bill you for
                products/services you purchased, and provide ongoing service and support. We may also contact you with
                information that might interest you, including information about products and services of ours and
                others, or ask for your opinion about our products or the products of others. We use personal
                information for record keeping, analytical purposes, and research, development, and improvement of
                programs, products, services, and content.

                <br> <br>
                Personal information collected online may be combined with information you provide to us through other
                sources. We may also remove your personal identifiers (your name, email address, social security number,
                etc.), in which case you would no longer be identified as a single unique individual. Once we have
                de-identified information, it is non-personal information, and we may treat it like other non-personal
                information. Finally, we may use your personal information to protect our rights or property, protect
                someone’s health, safety, or welfare, and comply with a law or regulation, court order, or other legal
                processes.

            </p>
            <h1>DOES EXISTING HOMEBUYERS SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHERS?
            </h1>
            <p>We will not share your personal information collected from this website with an unrelated third party
                without your permission, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. In the ordinary course of
                business, we may share some personal information with companies we hire to perform services or functions
                on our behalf. In all cases where we share your personal information with a third party for the purpose
                of providing a service to us, we will not authorize them to keep, disclose, or use your information with
                others except for the purpose of providing the services we asked them to provide.
                <br> <br>
                We will not sell, exchange, or publish your personal information, except in conjunction with a corporate
                sale, merger, dissolution, or acquisition. For some types of transactions, in addition to our direct
                collection of information, our third-party service vendors (such as credit card companies,
                clearinghouses, and banks) may collect personal information directly from you to assist you with your
                transaction. We do not control how these third parties use such information, but we do ask them to
                disclose how they use your personal information before they collect it. We may be legally compelled to
                release your personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law, or
                regulation.
                <br> <br>
                We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting website visitors who
                violate our rules or engage in behavior that is harmful to other visitors (or illegal). We may disclose
                your personal information to third parties if we feel the disclosure is necessary to protect our rights
                or property, protect someone’s health, safety, or welfare, or comply with a law or regulation, court
                order, or other legal processes.

                you to communicate with us using an online form. If your communication requests a response from us, we
                may send you a response via email. The email response or confirmation may include your personal
                information. We cannot guarantee that our emails to you will be secure from unauthorized interception.

                personnel and third-party vendors have access to your personal information, and these employees and
                vendors are required to treat this information as confidential. Despite these precautions, we cannot
